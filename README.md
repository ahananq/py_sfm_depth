A tutorial is availible from [the github.io page for this repository](https://geojames.github.io/py_sfm_depth/)

There are currently two versions of the script:
>v1.0 - was writen in Python 2.7 and requires apptional libraries: wx, numpy, pandas, sympy, matplotlib
>      *wx is not in most scientific python distrobutions

>v1.1 - is for Python 3.5 and only requires: tkinter, numpy, pandas, sympy, matplotlib
>     which are included in most of the scientific python distrobutions
